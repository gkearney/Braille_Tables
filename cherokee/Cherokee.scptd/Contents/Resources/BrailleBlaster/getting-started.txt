You will find the real getting-started documents in the helpDocs 
subdirectory (or folder). You will want to read the turorial first. 
However, the following information may be useful.

After you have downloaded the BrailleBlaster build for your platform and 
architecture, unzip it and go to the folder (directory) which it 
produces. You will need a Java Runtime Environment, which your machine 
probably already has. Put a shortcut to brailleblaster.jar on your 
desktop. You can also run it from a command line or terminal as 
described in the helpDocs files.
